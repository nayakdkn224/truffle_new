1) Explain briefly the steps involved in initiating a project in Truffle

Ans:- for initiating a Truffle Project first we need to  create a Dirictory for Smartcontrat 

command is 
     step -1     mkdir Metacoin  
step-2   then come into the folder by cd Metacoin  , 
step-3   then truffle compile  command is -  truffle compile 
step -4   then for initiate a bare project   command is truffle init  
and demonstrate the same


. 2) How to Write and Compile a Solidity Smart Contract file using
Truffle?

step -1 first we need to create a project  dirictory  MetaCoin
step2  then instal truffle 
step3   then unbox the truffle box  command is truffle unbox MetaCoin 
step 4- then we got dirictorys and contract files then we write our project smart work then we start the next step
step 5   truffle  develop
step 6  truffle compile 
step 7 truffle migrate  


3) Demonstrate the process of deploying smart contracts on
Ganache using Truffle suite. 


step -1 first we need to create a project  dirictory  MetaCoin
step2  then instal truffle 
step3   then unbox the truffle box  command is truffle unbox MetaCoin 
step 4- then we got dirictorys and contract files then we write our project smart work then we start the next step
step 5   truffle  develop
step 6  truffle compile 
step 7 truffle migrate  

after that we need to change the code for 




Migrate with Truffle ConsoleÂ¶
While Truffle Develop is an all-in-one personal blockchain and console, it spins up a very basic instance of ganache. You can also use a desktop application, to launch your personal blockchain, which is an easier to understand tool for those new to Ethereum and the blockchain, as it displays much more information up-front. Alternatively, if you want to customize your ganache instance using all the options available to you through the ganache CLI

The only extra step, aside from running Ganache, is that it requires editing the Truffle configuration file to point to the Ganache instance.

Open truffle-config.js in a text editor. Replace the content with the following, ensuring your port number is correct:

module.exports  =    {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    }
  }
};
This will allow a connection using Ganache's default connection parameters.

Save and close that file.
